# HC-SR04--x2--WeMos-D1-Mini-Shield
Shield to attach two HC-SR04 ultrasonic distance sensors to a Wemos D1 Mini ESP8266 module.

Works with one or two sensors. The first is mounted to the shield, the second is intended to be mounted elsewhere and connected with a four-conductor cable.

Utilizes a BS138DW SOT-363 chip (which is just two BSS138 N-channel enhanced mode MOSFETs in one package) for level switching the ESP8266's 3.3V trigger pulse up to 5V for the sensors (ref: https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/using-the-logic-level-converter). The down-convert is a simple voltage divider. All resistors are 0805 size.

SENSE1 is mounted to the board
Trigger pin:  D3
Echo pin:  D4

SENSE2 (optional) can be located off-board
Trigger pin:  D7
Echo pin:  D8

The board and SENSE1 have been tested. Example Arduino sketches are in work.
